# Inventory Management App for Android

The app is designed ideally for small business owners or freelancers who want to keep track of their inventory in a simple yet easy to use app. As it is targeted towards small business owners, I wanted to keep the design simple and easy to use with minimal guidance.
The app allows the user to add a product, and then add transactional data for that product. It can keep track of how much quantity is entering/leaving.
# Features:
- Item and Order Card List - Showing details
- Add Item/Product or Order/Transaction
